1. SQL Scripts missing.
2. Tight coupled
   direct access of dao layer in controller, which is wrong
   controller->service->dao>repo
3. comments and java documentation
    each method should have the comments , explaining the implementation and author, version
4. Missing standard response
    ex: login api returning "Login successful!" for successfully login
    but expected
    {
        "status":true,
        "message":"Login successful!",
        "datetime": ----,
        "result":{}
    }
 5. implement swagger
